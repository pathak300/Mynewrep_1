            <b> Ex.President of India and Scientist </b> Nope var is a variable
            same as let, on both you can change the value later. The main
            difference is scope. If I declare a var in an if block I can still
            access it outside of the if. Var is also NOT global. It's scoped to
            functions and objects (same thing lol) blocks. Let is scoped to the
            enclosing {} no matter what those brackets belong to... Function,
            object, if, case... Whatever. Only minor exception is that block
            scope extends to variables defined in a loop too! ie: for(let
            x....){//x in scope here!} Nope var is a variable same as let, on
